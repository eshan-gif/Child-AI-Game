# Child-AI-Game
This game allows children to be aware of their trusted zones.
Theme: AI for social good.
Site Name: KidSafe Check

This project is a simple Child Safety Awareness Web App designed to help children learn about safe and unsafe situations through interactive content. Parents first enter trusted information such as their name, phone number, and address, which becomes the child’s verified “safe list.”
Children then explore a short awareness section and play a scenario-based quiz where they decide whether to share information or not. The quiz also checks if the child knows the correct parent details, reinforcing safe communication habits in a fun and engaging way.

USP
Parent-verified safe list: Only information approved by parents is used for validation.

Interactive learning: Kids learn through real-life scenarios instead of plain text.
