# KidSafe Check

**Theme**: AI for Social Good

This project is an interactive child-safety website that teaches children how to identify trusted people, avoid strangers, learn online safety, remember important contact details, and practice real-life safety situations.

## Unique Selling Points (USP)

**Personalized safety learning:** Uses the actual parent details entered in the form, so children learn using real names, phone numbers, and addresses.

**Built-in AI practice assistant:** A simple rule-based chatbot that answers children’s safety questions without needing internet or backend services.

**Completely offline:** Runs only on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Safe, private, and easy to use anywhere.

**Child-friendly design:** Simple language, clear layout, and easy-to-understand examples suitable for students.

**Practical learning approach:** Combines explanation, scenarios, and quizzes to reinforce safe decision-making.
